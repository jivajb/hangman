# Hangman

## Purpose

The purpose is to recreate the game Hangman in the programming language C.

## How to Use the Program

The user will input a secret word, which the other user will type in letters that will either reveal the letters or say that it was wrong, add a body part to the hangman, and write that that letter is eliminated. ./hangman <"secret word">

## Design

There will be a loop that waits for either the user to guess the word correctly or run out of guesses. There will be a loop for the input of the letters, and it will determine the value of the input as if it were a correct or wrong answer.
